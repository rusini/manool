MANOOL v0.3.0 (work in progress)
================================

MANOOL is a general-purpose programming language in the sense that there is no particular application domain fixed for it, and
it is instead broadly applicable across several application domains. However, it is meant to compare and compete directly with such
high-level languages as Python, PHP, Ruby, or Perl (i.e., so-called scripting languages).

In overall, MANOOL is a practical language: It is conceived as a simple but expressive tool useful in the professional field of
programming rather than to be particularly elegant, orthogonal, or easy to learn; although it actually is (all of these), by accident.
Likewise, it is not meant to be a proof of concept for any new programming techniques or mechanisms, although incidentally its syntax
and semantics do have a combination of unusual features.

MAnool is Not an Object-Oriented Language!
